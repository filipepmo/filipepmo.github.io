        <h2>Tuckman Team Development Model</h2>

        <h3>Building Effective Cross-Functional Teams</h3>
  
        <p>In order of importance:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Psychological safety</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk or a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Dependability</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time (vs the opposite - shirking responsibilities).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Structure and clarity</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one’s performance are important for team effectiveness. Goals can be set at the individual or group level, and must be specific, challenging, and attainable. Google often uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to help set and communicate short and long term goals.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Meaning</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness. The meaning of work is personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression for each individual, for example.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>The results of one’s work, the subjective judgement that your work is making a difference, is important for teams. Seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals can help reveal impact.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
