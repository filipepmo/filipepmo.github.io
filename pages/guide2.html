        <h3 id="developing-people">Developing People on your Team</h3>

        <p>Training people and providing learning opportunities within the company is the way to develop
          people.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn from failure</strong><li>
              <ul>
                <li>Unless an organization punishes fails or unless fails are
                  thrown under the carpet. Neither is good practice. Fails should be addressed promptly blameless,
                  always with the possible “learn” in sight.</li>
                  <li>Hold regular retrospectives with actionable items</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical Mentoring</strong><li>
              <ul>
                <li>Pair Programming</li>
                <li>Code Reviews</li>
                <li>Mob Programming</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feedback cycles at regular intervals</strong><li>
              <ul>
                <li>Regular meetings with their people at regular intervals, e.g., every two weeks for 45 minutes (block 60).</li>
                <li>Feedback should be going in both directions because also people managers have to get the chance to learn.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Training Budget</strong><li>
              <ul>
                <li>May be used for training, conferences, travel, books</li>
                <li>Also allowed to “pay with your own time”, e.g., if you want to
                  learn for a certificate or do an online-course, you will need more time than attending an
                  on-site training.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inspiration time</strong><li>
              <ul>
                <li>hackathons, free hacking time, design and innovation
                  sprints, solution labs and so on.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3 id="fun">Promoting fun at work</h3>

        <p>It is widely believed that a fun working environment is much more productive than a routine working environment.</p>

        <p>As managers I believe one should pay attention to build culture through informal forms of fun.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311357296_Finding_Fun_in_Work_The_Effect_of_Workplace_Fun_on_Taking_Charge_and_Job_Engagement">research here</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240318285_Does_fun_work_The_complexity_of_promoting_fun_at_work">here</a>, there are three aspects that influence employee engagement at work:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fun activities</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Collect qualitative informal feedback: What does fun at work mean to different people?</li>
            <li>Before a meetings start, to loosen the atmosphere, do a small fun activity such as a Quizz</li>
            <li>Diversify: do not repeat the same activity over and over just because 'it was such fun that one time'</li>
            <li>Use 'fun' in sprint cerimonies (if using scrum) such as the retrospective or sprint review and change around the formats</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Socializing with coworkers and celebrating at work</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Openly discuss with the team a day per week or each two weeks where we all can be together in the office</li>
            <li>When working remotely have a (voluntary) open Teams, Slack, etc. channel that people can join in and discuss things while they work</li>
            <li>Make 'giving kudos' the first part of retrospectives and postmortem culture to highlight the good things</li>
            <li>Celebrate quarterly achievements by teams and individuals</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Manager support for fun</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on improving the process by holding relaxed fun activities where people can socialize (e.g. see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/">Game Days</a>), do not focus on the people</li>
            <li>Simply remove 'un-fun' tasks: Get rid of administrative tasks that do not add value and only cause overhead to workers</li>
            <li>Listen to feedback: do not pressure employees to take part in a 'fun activity': doing so can generate anxiety as the result of that pressure</li>
            <li>Support a relaxed team environment by not making too many rules that create a strict environment (e.g. "don't make too much noise" or "don't use your phone")</li>
            <li>Treat people like professionals, not children that you need to micro-manage</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="effective-teams">Effective Teams</h3>
  
        <p>In order of importance:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Psychological safety</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk or a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Dependability</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time (vs the opposite - shirking responsibilities).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Structure and clarity</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one’s performance are important for team effectiveness. Goals can be set at the individual or group level, and must be specific, challenging, and attainable. Google often uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to help set and communicate short and long term goals.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Meaning</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness. The meaning of work is personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression for each individual, for example.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong><li>
            <ul>
              <li>The results of one’s work, the subjective judgement that your work is making a difference, is important for teams. Seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals can help reveal impact.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
