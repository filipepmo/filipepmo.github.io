        <h2>III. Team Development Model</h2>

        <h3>A. How teams develop over time</h3>

        <p>Teams take time to <u>work together effectively as a unit.</u></p> 
        <p>Tuckman’s theory of group development asserts that 
          a team goes through a series of suboptimal phases (forming, storming, and norming) before it finds its groove 
          in the performing phase.</p>

        <h3>B. Tuckman's Team Development Model</h3>

        <p>Based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358570399_Phases_of_Team_Development_Update_for_2022">this document</a>.</p>
